This is a personal project of mine to help with better time management.
This is one of my first projects that I have completed apart from a course that is not game related.
If you wish to extend it to run on other OSs you are free to do so.

Requirements

NW.js

Nodejs

On Ubuntu you need 'play'

Install with: sudo apt install sox

And if you get an error with playing the sound file: sudo apt install libsox-fmt-all


Running it

To run the JS follow the instructions on the NW.js website for running programs

Run the Python 'schedule_app.py' from within the 'tasks_output' directory
